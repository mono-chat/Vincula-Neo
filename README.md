# MSNChat-Script-Archive

An archival repository preserving MSN Chat related scripts, modifications, and tools.

While the vast majority of the collection consists of mIRC scripts, the archive also features standalone executables and extensions intended for alternative IRC clients.

## License & Attribution

During the era of MSN Chat, scripts and modifications were openly shared within the community. While formal open-source licenses were rarely used, there was a well-established honor system: **anyone creating derivative works or modifying existing scripts was expected to properly attribute the original author.**

In keeping with this tradition, this repository does not enforce a strict formal license. You are free to explore, learn from, and modify the contents. We only ask that you respect the original unwritten rule of the community by giving credit to the original creators when building upon their work.

## Disclaimer

**Please note that this repository serves purely as a historical archive.** 

The scripts, executables, and modifications provided herein are offered "as is" without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. Due to the volume and age of the materials, we have not independently audited every individual file. We cannot guarantee the safety, functionality, or security of these items, nor can we ensure they are devoid of undocumented features, vulnerabilities, or malicious code that may have been present in their original distribution.

Users are strongly advised to exercise caution and perform their own due diligence, such as reviewing source code or utilizing isolated environments, before compiling or executing any unfamiliar software from this archive. Use of any materials found in this repository is strictly at your own risk.
